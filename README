A Game Framework for the Java Programming Language
GWorks is a personal project.
Built on Java2D and awt, GWorks is a simple gaming library providing support for graphics and (eventually) sound.
Although built on Java2D, Gworks still provides VSYNC, double (or more) buffering, and hardware acceleration.
GWorks Lib is the main library for the project.
  Included:
    Basics:
      GCanvas: The game canvas which displays GStates
      GState: Game states which consist of render listeners and tick listeners
      GRenderListeners: Updates the canvas using a Java2D graphics object
      GTickListeners: Updates game state
    Higher level:
      Sprite: Hardware accelerated sprite class providing for animations and filters.
      GMenuState: System for game menus
      GSpriteSheet: Allows for loading of spritesheets
    
GSpriteSheet Mapper provides the ability to map sprites from a sprite sheet into GWorks compatible JSON.

GWorks Test contains a few basic render tests for the Gworks suite.

Finally, BlockDude is a reference implementation and proving ground for GWorks. Slowly pieces of code are being built in BlockDude and moved into Gworks if deemed essential.

The build order for the project is:
  GWorks Lib
  GWorks Test
  GSpriteSheet Mapper
  BlockDude (Depends on GWorks test)
GWorks Lib and GWorks Test must be installed to your local maven repository.

Eventually a master pom will be built to automate building the project.

GWorks Lib is not currently hosted in maven central.
